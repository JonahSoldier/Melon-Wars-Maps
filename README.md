# How to use/install:
In-order to spawn these maps you need [Advanced Duplicator 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=773402917&searchtext=advanced+duplicator).
If you don't already have it, go subscribe to it now. 

To download, click this button, then click "Download ZIP".
![Github code button](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/380492608910131212/1270056798120050768/image.png?ex=66b25011&is=66b0fe91&hm=16ec011b796bf97e6d343621f1b3b10c9ac22b302eb25102a1f8ee92a37582fe&)
Afterwards, **extract** the zip file, and put the extracted file into **this** directory.
![Advdupe2 data folder file path](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/380492608910131212/1270053995683250267/image.png?ex=66b24d75&is=66b0fbf5&hm=1a07843a34bc71e73bb5c3afc3b91710bb58e668dcbea87662407ff5275b308b&)
This folder should already exist if you've been on a server with Advdupe2 before, but if it doesn't you can just create a folder with the **exact same name**, and it'll work fine.

You'll want to remove .gitattributes and README.md. Having them in your advdupe2 folder shouldn't(?) break anything, but you'll see them as (unopenable) files in the browser in-game.

In-game, find the Advanced Duplicator 2 tool, click on it, and in the panel on the right of the spawn menu you'll be able to navigate through the files/folders. 

You can expand folders by clicking the + next to them, and you can open them by right-clicking and selecting open.
A transparent version of the map should be displayed infront of you. You can rotate it by holding E, and snap to 45Â° angles by holding shift. 

# A bit about the maps themselves

A handful of the maps use [Wiremod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=773402917&searchtext=advanced+duplicator) or prop2mesh for extra detailing. All of these are playable without wire/p2m, but might look a bit ugly. The ones that make use of these addons have had w (for wire) or m (for p2m) added to the ends of their names.

The maps in this collection were made over a very long time period (2017-2023), so there are some pretty big differences in style and polish between the earliest ones and latest ones. That said I've only included maps that are *still* played semi-frequently. Siege and Grid being prime examples of that. Anything that was played once or twice and never again has been excluded.

Most maps use metal plates ```models/props_phx/construct/metal_plate2x2.mdl``` to indicate *intended* HQ locations. You're free to completely disregard these, but they're useful for ensuring bases aren't too far back/forwards.

The 3 categories represent different overall map-structures. 
**teams** maps have a single line of symmetry down the middle, and are intended for 2 balanced/equal teams. These include 1v1 maps, 2v2s, 3v3s, etc.
**FFA** maps have at least 2 lines of symmetry and give each HQ balanced/equal starting conditions relative to each-other. These can be played as 2v2s or 1v1s too, but are more suitable for FFA.
**Asymmetric** maps are, well, asymmetrical. Each HQ location has substantially different advantages/disadvantages. This includes both maps where HQs are clumped into defined sides/teams, and ones where there aren't any set teams/HQ locations.
